# Proposal for atomic payments redesign

14.05.2019, real

## Abstract

This is a proposal for a new design for the core credit system for Offset,
allowing for atomic transactions.


## Current design

The current Offset design allows parties in a decentralized credit graph to push
payments along routes. In the current design, payments are guaranteed to
eventually resolve (To either success or failure). However, it is not known how
long it could take for payments to eventually resolve. 

We shortly describe the current Offset design. To see a more detailed
explanation, see: ["How offset works?"](theory.md).

Consider the following route:

```text
B --- C --- D --- E
```

Suppose that B wants to send credits to E along this route.
First a request message is sent from B all the way to E, freezing credits along
the way. 

```text
  -----[req]---->
B --- C --- D --- E
```

During the request period, if any node can not freeze enough credits with the next
node, the request will be cancelled by sending a backwards failure message:

```text
 ----[req]-->
 <--[fail]---
B --- C --- D --- E
```

In the figure above, D cancelled the payment request because not enough credits
were available to freeze between D and E.


If the request arrives at E successfully, E will send a response message all the
way back to B. Every hop of the response message unfreezes credits and
completes a payment.

```text
 -------[req]----->
 <------[resp]-----
B --- C --- D --- E
```

In the figure above: A successful payment sent from B to E.

## Limitations of the current design

Consider the following route:

```text
B --- C --- D --- E
```

And imagine the payment experience from the point of view of the node B.
To pay E, B first issues a request message. After issuing this message, B has
no more control over the payment process. All B can do is wait for the
transaction to complete.

The request message sent from B might delay or get stuck in any hop from B to
E. B has no means of knowing what is the current position of the request
message, and has no ability to cancel that message. 

Theoretically at the request period it should be possible for B to cancel the payment
(Because no payment was actually done yet), however, B can only communicate
with his direct friends and therefore has no means of cancelling. In other
words, the current protocol design doesn't support it.

After the request message arrives at E (If it does arrive at E), a response
message leaves E back to B. This response message might also delay or get stuck
in any hop from E to B. At this stage it is not possible to cancel the payment,
because some funds were already transferred (First from D to E, then from C to D etc.)

If B is waiting at a store attempting to buy something, it is not acceptable
that B will wait more than a few seconds. We would like to have some way to
send a payment atomically: Either the transaction occurs in a short period of time, or it
doesn't happen at all.

## Offline payment processing

The current design (two trips: request message and response message) has the
advantage of allowing the seller to be disconnected from the Internet (And from
the Offset network).

We describe a full buying story:

1. A buyer wants to buy an item.
2. The seller produces a random invoice value and hands it to the buyer.
3. The buyer sends a payment with the invoice provided by the seller (By
   sending a request message along a route)
4. The buyer receives a receipt (As a response message).
5. The buyer shows the receipt to the seller, and the seller can confirm
   the payment is valid.
6. The seller hands the buyer the bought goods.


```text
     /---------[response]--------
     | /-------[request]-------->
     | |
     | |   B ==== C ==== D ==== E
     | |   |
     | |   |
     | |   |     
     | |   | 
     | | +----+    Invoice    +----+
     | \-|    |<--------------|    |
     |   | B' |    Receipt    | E' |
     \---|    |-------------->|    |
         +----+               +----+
```

In the figure above one can see the process of payment from B to E.
B is the buyer's node and E is the seller's node. B' is the buyer client, and
E' is the seller's client. The buying process:

- E' sends an invoice to B'
- B' sends the invoice to B.
- B sends a request to E along a route.
- E sends a response back to B along the same route.
- B sends B' a receipt.
- B' forwards the receipt to E'.

It can be seen that in this process the client E' does not need to be connected
to the node E (Hence no Internet connectivity is required).


## Proposed design outline (Atomic transactions)

Consider the following route:

```text
B --- C --- D --- E
```

Suppose that B wants to send credits to E along this route. We call B the
**buyer**, and E the **seller**.


```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
Response       <-----[resp]-------

Commit         ======[commit]====>    (Out of band)
Goods          <=====[goods]======    (Out of band)

Collect        <-----[collect]----
(Receipt)
               B --- C --- D --- E
```


The following operations occur:

1. E hands an Invoice to B. (Out of band)
2. B sends a Request message along a path to E.
3. E sends back a Response message along the same route to B.
4. B prepares a Commit message and hands it to E (Out of band).
5. E sends a Collect message along the route to B.
6. B receives the Collect message, prepares a Receipt and keeps it.


From the point of view of Offset users, this is how a transaction looks like:

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)
Commit         ======[commit]====>    (Out of band)
Goods          <=====[goods]======    (Out of band)
               B -- ...   ... -- E
```

Note that the event of B handing the confirmation to E is atomic. The moment
this event happens, the transaction is considered successful. Note however,
that it might take some time until the seller E will be able to
collect his credits.

Cancellation can happen at any time after the Request message was sent from the
buyer and before the Collect message was sent.

During the Request stage a cancellation message could be sent from any node
forwarding the Request message. However, after the Request message arrives at
the seller node, only the seller node may issue a cancellation message. (This
rule has one exception that happens during unfriending, see below).


### Examples for cancellation

- An intermediate node cancels the transaction during the Request period.
    This can happen for example if there is not enough capacity for pushing
    credits forward.

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ---[req]---->
Cancel         <--[cancel]--

               B --- C --- D --- E
```

- invoiceId is not recognized (by E):

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
Cancel         <-----[cancel]-----

               B --- C --- D --- E
```


- Commit took too long to arrive:

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
Response       <-----[resp]-------
Cancel         <-----[cancel]-----

               B --- C --- D --- E
```

- Cancellation in Request period that happens due to unfriending nodes:

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
               B --- C --- D --- E
Unfriend
Cancel         <--[cancel]--
               B --- C --- D     E
```

In the figure above: a request was sent from B to E. Next, D unfriends E before
E manages to send the response message. In that case D sends a Cancel message
for this transaction all the way back to B, and the transaction credits are
unfrozen.


- Cancellation in Response period that happens due to unfriending nodes:

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
Response       <-----[resp]-------
               B --- C --- D --- E
Unfriend
Cancel         <--[cancel]--
               B --- C --- D     E
```


## Messages definitions


### (*) Request message

```text
 -------[req]----->
B --- C --- D --- E
```

This is the structure of the request message:

```capnp
struct RequestSendFundsOp {
        requestId @0: Uid;
        # Randomly generated reqeustId [128 bits]
        srcHashedLock @1: HashedLock;
        # bcrypt(srcPlainLock), where srcPlainLock is of size 256 bits.
        route @2: FriendsRoute;
        # A route of friends that leads to the destination
        destPayment @3: CustomUInt128;
        # Amount of credits to pay the destination over this route.
        totalDestPayment @4: CustomUInt128;
        # Total amount of credits to be paid (Must match the invoice)
        # totalDestPayment > destPayment in cases of multi route-payments.
        invoiceId @4: InvoiceId;
        # A 256 bit value representing the invoice this request
        # intends to pay.
}
```

The request message mainly verifies that there is enough capacity to make the
payment along the route (Including capacity for the transaction fees). 
For example, if B wants to send 10 credits to E, then during the request
message passage from B to E:

- B checks that B -> C has at least the capacity of 12 credits.
- C checks that C -> D has at least the capacity of 11 credits.
- D checks that D -> E has at least the capacity of 10 credits.

The extra credits are due to transaction fees to C and D (1 credit each).


The Request message contains a hash lock: `srcHashedLock`. This value is
generated by the buyer by generating a random `srcPlainLock`
value and hashing it: `srcHashedLock := bcrypt(srcPlainLock)`. This
mechanism is used to ensure transaction atomicity: The seller can not create a
valid Collect message without knowing the secret value `srcPlainLock`.

### (*) Response message

If all went well during the Request stage, E sends back a Response message
along the same path, all the way back to B.


```text
 <------[resp]-----
B --- C --- D --- E
```

```capnp
struct ResponseSendFundsOp {
        requestId @0: Uid;
        destHashedLock @1: HashedLock;
        randNonce @2: RandNonce;
        signature @3: Signature;
        # Signature{key=destinationKey}(
        #   sha512/256("FUNDS_RESPONSE") ||
        #   sha512/256(requestId || randNonce) ||
        #   srcHashedLock ||
        #   destHashedLock ||
        #   destPayment ||
        #   totalDestPayment ||
        #   invoiceId
        # )
        #
        # Note that the signature contains an inner blob (requestId || ...).
        # This was done to make the size of the receipt shorter, as previously
        # this contained a full route.
}
```

Note that the response contains a `destHashedLock`. This value is created by
hashing a secret generated by the seller: `destHashedLock :=
bcrypt(destPlainLock)`. This secret will only be revealed when the Collect
message is sent. We have this mechanism to defend against fake Receipt
generated by the buyer. (A valid receipt must contain the secret
`destPlainLock`).

### (*) Cancel message

A Cancel message may be sent back by any node during the Request period.
After Request message arrived at the seller node and before the Collect
message was sent, only the seller node may send a Cancel message. 
In addition, any node may send a Cancel message to cancel ongoing transactions
in case of unfriending a node (As long as the Collect message was not yet
received).

After the Collect message was received, the transaction can not be cancelled.

If any node could not forward the request message, or the destination decided
to cancel the transaction, a failure message will be sent back, beginning from
the failing node.

A cancel message can be sent as long as **receipt message** was not yet sent.

```text
 <----[cancel]-----
B --- C --- D --- E
```

```capnp
struct CancelSendFundsOp {
        requestId @0: Uid;
}
```

### (*) Commit message (Out of band)

After receiving a Response message, the source node of the payment creates a
Commit message. The Commit message is given to the destination, and
at that moment the payment is considered successful. 

```text
======[commit]====>    (Out of band)
B --- C --- D --- E
```

Upon receipt of a valid Commit message, the seller will give the goods to
the buyer, and send back (along the same route) a Collect message to collect his
credits.

```capnp
struct Commit {
        responseHash @0: Hash;
        # = sha512/256(requestId || randNonce)
        destPayment @1: CustomUInt128;
        # Amount of credits paid in this Transaction.
        srcPlainLock @2: PlainLock;
        # The preimage of the hashedLock at the request message [256 bits]
        destHashedLock @3: HashedLock;
        signature @4: Signature;
        # Signature{key=destinationKey}(
        #   sha512/256("FUNDS_RESPONSE") ||
        #   sha512/256(requestId || sha512/256(route) || randNonce) ||
        #   srcHashedLock || 
        #   destHashedLock || 
        #   destPayment ||
        #   totalDestPayment ||
        #   invoiceId
        # )
}

struct MultiCommit {
        invoiceId @0: InvoiceId;
        # InvoiceId being paid.
        totalDestPayment @1: CustomUInt128;
        # The total amount being paid
        commits @2: List(Commit);
        # A list of confirmations. Each confirmation corresponds to a request
        # sent along one route.
}
```

Note that the `MultiCommit` message may contain multiple
`Commit`-s, each corresponding to one request. This allows
fragmented payment along multiple routes.

Verification of a MultiCommit message by the seller is done as follows:

- InvoiceId matches an originally issued invoice.
- For every Commit:
    - The revealed lock is valid: 
        `bcrypt(srcPlainLock) == srcHashedLock`
    - signature is valid.
- Total of `destPayment` is correct (Equal the requested amount at the
    invoice).


### (*) Collect message

After receiving a confirmation message from the buyer, the destination
gives the goods to the buyer and sends back a Collect message to
collect his credits.

```text
 <----[collect]----
B --- C --- D --- E
```


A Collect message completes the transaction. For example, when the Collect
message is sent from E to D, the credits that were frozen between D and E
become unfrozen, and the payment is irreversible. The Collect messages continues
all the way (along the original route) to the source of the payment.


```capnp
struct CollectSendFundsOp {
        requestId @0: Uid;
        srcPlainLock @1: PlainLock;
        destPlainLock @2: PlainLock;
}
```

Note that the Collect message can only be sent by the seller after
it has received the confirmation, because the confirmation contains the
srcPlainLock.

When receiving a CollectSendFundsOp messages, the following should be verified:

- `bcrypt(srcPlainLock) = srcHashedLock`
- `bcrypt(destPlainLock) = destHashedLock`


### (*) Receipt

Upon receiving the Receipt message, the source of the payment can compose a
Receipt.

```capnp
struct Receipt {
        responseHash @0: Hash;
        # = sha512/256(requestId || randNonce)
        invoiceId @1: InvoiceId;
        srcPlainLock @2: PlainLock;
        destPlainLock @3: PlainLock;
        destPayment @4: CustomUInt128;
        totalDestPayment @4: CustomUInt128;
        signature @5: Signature;
        # Signature{key=destinationKey}(
        #   sha512/256("FUNDS_RESPONSE") ||
        #   sha512/256(requestId || sha512/256(route) || randNonce) ||
        #   srcHashedLock || 
        #   dstHashedLock || 
        #   destPayment ||
        #   totalDestPayment ||
        #   invoiceId
        # )
}
```

The Receipt can be constructed only after the CollectSendFundsOp message was received.
Note that it is possible that a receipt can be constructed only a long time
after the confirmation message was given.


## Atomicity

Atomicity is guaranteed by using a [hash
lock](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashlock) created by the buyer:
`srcHashedLock`.

Assume that the node E issued an invoice and handed it to B.

B wants to pay the invoice. The payment begins by sending a Request message
along the path from B to E. The payment is considered successful when B hands a
MultiCommit message to E. 

This means that we should examine the possibility of B waiting indefinitely
during the sending of Request and Response messages along the route.

During this time (Request + Response period), B can discard the transaction by
walking away. E will not be able to make progress because in order to send the
Collect message, the correct srcPlainLock is required, but E does not know it
before B sends the MultiCommit message.

Also note that if B sends a valid MultiCommit message to E, the transaction is
considered successful, and B can not reverse it. This happens because B reveals
srcPlainLock at the MultiCommit message sent to E.


## Receipt verifiability

A receipt is a proof that a certain invoice was paid. It can be verified by
anyone that possesses: 

- The invoice (`invoiceId` + public key of seller)
- The Receipt

Verification is performed by checking the signature (See description of signature at
the Receipt definition).

In order to make sure the buyer can not have a valid Receipt before the payment
actually completed, we use a hash lock that is issued by the payment
destination: `destHashedLock`.

When the buyer receives a Response message it can not yet create a
valid Receipt, because the buyer doesn't yet know `destPlainLock`.
This value is revealed only at the Collect message, when the payment is
considered to be successful.

Note: An alternative solution could be to let the seller sign a new
signature over the Collect message, but instead we chose to use a hash lock,
which is a less expensive cryptographic operation. Using a hash lock also does
not require access to the identity of the seller.

This leaves the whole protocol with only one cryptographic signature over the
Response message, signed by the seller.


## Cancellation responsibility

Only the seller can issue a Cancel message (Sent from the
destination along a path to the source). A Cancel message will be sent by the
Offset node automatically for any incoming Request message that contains a non
recognized InvoiceId (TODO: Can this cause any issues?)

In addition, cancellation can be issued for a certain `invoiceId` from the
application level. Cancellation message should only be sent after the invoice was
issued and before a Commit message was received. It might be possible for
applications to cancel `invoiceId`-s after a certain amount of time.

- Sending a Cancel message after a Commit message was received is
    considered a bad form for the seller, and can be seen
    as equivalent to not delivering the goods after a successful payment. 

- Sending a Cancel
    message after the goods were given to the buyer will cause the
    seller to lose credits.


The only way for the buyer to cancel a transaction is by never
sending a Commit message to the seller.


## Fragmented/Multi-Route transactions

Sometimes it might not be possible to send a payment along a single route.
In such cases it is useful to send the transaction along multipe
routes. The protocol allows sending a payment along multiple routes atomically.
This is done as follows:

1. Buyer gets an Invoice from the seller for a certain amount of
   credits.
2. Buyer sends a RequestSendFundsOp along a route.
3. A ResponseSendFundsOp or a CancelSendFundsOp message is returned.
4. Go back to (2) until the wanted amount of credits is acheived (for paying
   the invoice).
5. Buyer sends a MultiCommit message containing a list of all
   Commit-s for all the requests that got a valid response.
6. Seller verifies the MultiCommit message. If valid, the payment is accepted
   and the goods are handed to the buyer.
7. The Seller sends back CollectSendFundsOp messages for all requests.
8. Any CollectSendFundsOp message can be used to create a valid Receipt. (Two diferent
   constructed receipts will have the same invoiceId but different
   responseHash).


## Extra: Non-atomic payment without Commit

Consider the following route:

```text
B --- C --- D --- E
```

Suppose that B wants to send credits to E without any atomicity guarantees. 

For example, B might want to send a donation to E. Therefore B does not care
about the atomicity of the transaction.

The resulting protocol is as follows:

```text
Invoice        <=====[inv]========    (Out of band)

Request        ------[req]------->
Response       <-----[resp]-------

Collect        <-----[collect]----
(Receipt)
               B --- C --- D --- E
```

(Note that the Out of band Invoice part is optional).

This can be achieved by having B choose a well known value for `srcPlainLock`,
for example, 256 consecutive zero bytes (`'\x00' * 256`). This should allow E
to "guess" `srcPlainLock` and send back a Collect message immediately.
Therefore the out of band Commit message sent from B is not required.

This construction allows taking donations through a static HTTPS webpage.
All one has to do is publish his public key. We are still not though sure if
adding this guessing feature will have real world uses.

Idea: Change `srcHashedLock` to be a sum type of None or srcHashedLock?
This way guessing will not be required. Might depend on the hash and salt
representation.

Note: We can not use this for multi-route payments.

## Application interface

We describe here Offset nodes' interface with an Application.
(Unrelated interface messages are not mentioned here for clarity).

The interface is split here between Buyer and Seller for clarity, however note
that there is only one Node implementation, and both the Buyer and the Seller
use this implementation.

### Buyer interface

```markdown
CreatePayment [App -> Node]
=============
- paymentId
- invoiceId
- totalDestPayment
- Destination public key

CreateTransaction [App -> Node]
=================
- paymentId
- requestId
- route
- fees
- destPayment

TransactionResult [Node -> App]
=================
- Response or Cancellation

<!--
SendFunds [App -> Node]
=========
(Extra: non atomic payment form)
- Destination public key
- Amount of credits
-->

RequestReceipt [App -> Node]
==============
- paymentId


ResponseReceipt [Node -> App]
===============
- Receipt or Empty


RemoveReceipt [App -> Node]
=============
- paymentId

```

To pay an invoice, a buyer can do the following:

- Send `RequestPay(invoice)` to the Node.
- Wait for `ResponsePay` to arrive from the Node. If waiting takes too long,
    forget about the payment.
- If `ResponsePay` contains cancel, cancel the payment.
  Else, send Commit to the seller.

After a while:

- Send `RequestReceipt` to the Node.
- If ResponseReceipt is Empty, try again at a later time.
  Else, keep the receipt in persistent storage and send `RemoveReceipt` to the Node.



### Seller interface

```markdown
AddInvoice [App -> Node]
===========
- invoiceId
- totalDestPayment


CancelInvoice [App -> Node]
==============
- invoiceId


CommitInvoice [App -> Node]
==============
- MultiCommit
```

Suppose that the seller has a website, and a user wants to buy an item on the
website. The seller will perform the following:

- Generate a new `invoiceId` and send `AddInvoice` to the Seller's Node.
- Send an invoice to the buyer (Out of band), and wait for Commit from
    the buyer.
- If waited too long for confirmation, send `CancelInvoice` to node and forget
    about this transaction.
- Receive a confirmation from the buyer (Out of band).
- Send `MultiCommit` to the Node.
