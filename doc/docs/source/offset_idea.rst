The Offset idea

   Important points to convey:
   - What is offset in a very short sentence.
   - What can I do with Offset?
   - How is offset different from other known things (Credit cards, banks, bitcoin)

What is Offset?
----------------

Offset is a credit card powered by trust between people. Payments in Offset are
secure, cheap, fast and privacy preserving. In addition, Offset lets you pay
with any currency you like.

You can pay with Offset at the local grocery store by scanning
a QR code, or buy something online from the other side of the world, possibly
from someone you have never met. As a merchant, Offset gives you the freedom to
sell without having to pay the extra fees to a payment processor.

Most importantly, Offset gives **you** the control. Offset is free and open
source [1]_. There is no single "Offset server", as Offset is fully decentralized. 
Your Offset credit fits nicely into your mobile phone [2]_, and you are the
only one having control over those credits. 

This means, for example, that you can open as many Offset cards as you like
without having to pay any fees. It also means that no one can track your
transactions [3]_ or freeze your account.


How Offset works?
------------------

In traditional monetary systems, money is issued by the state. (For example, the
US dollar is issued by the USA government). Participants of the market can then
use the money issued by the state to buy and sell goods and services in the
market.

**Offset moves the power of issuing money from the state to the market
participants.** 

That is the single most important property of Offset.

To understand how Offset works, we begin with a small example.
